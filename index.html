    <h1>How to make cold brew coffee</h1>
    <li>
    1. Determine how many servings you want. The cold brew method makes a concentrate that you will add milk or water to. Just divide the number of cups you want by 2, this gives you how much water you need in cups and how much coffee you need in ounces.
    Let's say we will make 10 cups of coffee, for 2 cups for each weekday. You will need 5 cups of water and 5 oz of coffee by weight to make the concentrate.
    </li>

    2. Grind your beans on your coarsest setting, conversely grind it at the store or cafe at the coarsest setting. Or you can buy coffee that is specially ground for cold brews. Because the grinder will still make some small pieces, use a mesh strainer to get rid of the smallest bits.
    This will keep your coffee from getting bitter and cloudy.
    </li>

        3. Place the ground coffee in one of your air-tight containers.
    </li>
    <li>4. Add the water to the jar and seal tightly. Swirl the jar gently to get all the coffee wet.</li>
    <li>5. Place the jar in your fridge overnight</li>
    <li>6. The next morning, slowly pour the coffee through the mesh bag into your second container.</li>
    <li>7. Add one part coffee to 1 part milk or water. Store the rest of the concentrate in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.</li>
